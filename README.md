# Algolia Solution Architecture Assignment

## Brief

Our customer Spencer and Williams want to implement a _federated search experience_ which includes both products and related ted talks in the dropdown. They require guidance on how to do this and provided two data sets as well as their current implementation so we can build a demo showing how this might work. Using algolia.com/docs and the provided base repo, extend this experience to include ted talks in the dropdown for search.

## Data Sources

You can find both datasets in the data folder. You will need to push this data to Algolia.

## Get started

To run this project locally, install the dependencies and run the local server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Alternatively, you may use [Yarn](https://http://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see your app.

## Delivery

Once done please host the distribution on github pages and provide us a link to your demo along with the source code!
