# Algolia Solution Architecture Assignment

## Brief

Our customer Spencer and Williams want to implement a _federated search experience_ which includes both products and _query suggestions_ in the dropdown. They have asked for us to create a demo of this behaviour in their provided codebase.

Spencer and Williams have provided the raw product data and have asked for us to create the suggestions using Algolias query suggestions feature.

## Getting started

First you'll need to sign up for an Algolia account @ https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up
You can find the product dataset in the data folder. You will need to push this data to Algolia in your own application and connect the app to the dataset in both components.
You can create a Query Suggestions index from your Algolia trial account following our documentation

Everything you need to complete this assignment can be found on algolia.com/docs
